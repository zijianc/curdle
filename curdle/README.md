# CITS3007 project "skeleton" code

This zip file contains "skeleton" source code for the CITS3007 "Curdle"
project, together with unit tests which use the Check unit-testing
framework.

It is *not* necessary to use these in completing the project, but you
are free to use them if you wish.
In particular, your submitted `adjust_score.c` file may `#include` the
`curdle.h` header file, if you wish to make use of the macros and struct in
that header file.

Do not submit any files from this zip file other than your completed
`adjust_score.c` file, and do not amend the `curdle.h` file.
If you do, any additional files will at best be discarded (and
you are likely to receive a lower mark for code style and clarity).
At worst, if the marker cannot work out which parts are your own submitted
work, or if your submitted code fails to compile, you may receive a mark of 0.

The only files you should submit are listed in the project spec:

1. a PDF report, `report.pdf`
2. a text file containing the answer to
   a question (`answers.txt`), and
3. a C file, `adjust_score.c`
